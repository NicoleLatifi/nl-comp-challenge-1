# Static Composition Challenge

## About

This is a solo project completed over one week during Module 1 at Turing School of Software and Design. The goal of this project is to recreate a webpage based off of a given static composition image with limited allowance for deviating from the original design. No assets or native files were provided.

## Wins

 - Used grid and flex displays in CSS to create desired layouts
 - Added multiple breakpoints that make the page responsive
 - Used normalize.css to make webpage display consistently across different browsers

## Challenges

 - Matching fonts and colors
 - Making CSS readable
 - Knowing where to start and how to organize my work process

## Technologies Used

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Git/GitHub

- The three images below show my responsive layout that changes from four columns to three columns and then finally two columns depending upon the screen size.
